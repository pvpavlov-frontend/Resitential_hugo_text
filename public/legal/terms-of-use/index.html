Your use of the App Store Sourced Application must comply with the App Store Terms of Service.</li>
<li>You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App Store Sourced Application.</li>

<li>You acknowledge that, as between Cash Raven and Apple, Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims you have or any claims of any third party relating to the App Store Sourced Application or your possession and use of the App Store Sourced Application, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App Store Sourced Application fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection, privacy, or similar legislation.</li>
<li>In the event of any third-party claim that the App Store Sourced Application or your possession and use of that App Store Sourced Application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, you acknowledge that Apple will have no responsibility for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim.</li>
<li>You acknowledge that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms as related to your license of the App Store Sourced Application, and that, upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms as related to your license of the App Store Sourced Application against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.</li>
<li>Without limiting any other terms hereof, you must comply with all applicable third-party terms of other agreements when using the App Store Sourced Application.</li>
