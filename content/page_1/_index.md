<p class="c0"><span class="c3">GDPR</span></p>
<p class="c0">
    <span class="c1"
    >The General Data Protection Regulation (the &ldquo;GDPR&rdquo;), which
    became effective on May 25, 2018, creates consistent data protection
    rules across Europe. &nbsp;It applies to all companies that process data
    about individuals in the European Union. &nbsp;The GDPR imposes
    responsibilities on &ldquo;data controllers&rdquo; and &ldquo;data
    processors.&rdquo; &nbsp;A company is a &ldquo;data controller&rdquo;
    when it has the responsibility of determining why and how personal data
    is processed. &nbsp;A company is a &ldquo;data processor&rdquo; when it
    processes personal data on behalf of a data controller. &nbsp;While Cash
    Raven mostly operates as a data controller, there are some instances in
    which Cash Raven operates as a data processor, particularly when working
    with customers and other third parties. &nbsp;To the extent Cash Raven
    acts as a data processor, Cash Raven is committed to complying with the
    GDPR&rsquo;s specific requirements for data processors and we will work
    with customers and to update any related privacy policies on other
    websites.</span

<p class="c0">
    <span class="c1"
    >This Policy is designed to address only Cash Raven&rsquo;s data
    practices with respect to activities conducted by Cash Raven on its own
    behalf or through the Site. &nbsp;For those activities, Cash Raven acts
    as a data controller and may appoint third parties to act as data
    processor on its behalf, such as Google Analytics, and as further set
    forth herein. &nbsp;Cash Raven is committed to ensuring that it has
    appropriate terms in place with such partners so that both Cash Raven
    and the partners comply with their respective requirements under the
    GDPR.</span

<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0">
    <span class="c1"
    >Data controllers must have a legal basis to process your personal
    information. &nbsp;Cash Raven&rsquo;s legal basis to process your
    information arises from Cash Raven&rsquo;s need to use your information
    to provide you with the services and customer support and to advance
    Cash Raven&rsquo;s other legitimate interests (including operating the
    Site, conducting direct and indirect marketing, etc.), as discussed more
    fully in this Policy. &nbsp;Cash Raven also relies on your consent in
    some circumstances as the basis for processing your personal

    rectification or erasure, (iii) to restrict the processing of your
    personal information, and (iv) if applicable, to data portability.
