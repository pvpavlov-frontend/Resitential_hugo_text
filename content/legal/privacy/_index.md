### **Cash Raven Privacy Policy**{class="text-center" id=""}

##### Introduction

Welcome to the **https://cashraven.io/** website (the “Site”), which is owned and operated by Cash Raven, LLC (“Cash Raven” or “we” or “us”). We are committed to protecting your privacy. We have established this privacy policy (this “Privacy Policy”), and are providing it to you so that you can understand the manner in which we collect, use, maintain, and disclose your information and the efforts we use to protect it. This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect: (a) on this Site; (b) in email, text, and other electronic messages between you and this Site; and (c) through any mobile and desktop application (“Application”) you download from this Site or from a third party from whom you received the application license, e.g. the Apple App Store or Google Play Store (“App Store”) with an authorized link to this Privacy Policy. Please note that this Privacy Policy is for the Cash Raven website and does not apply to third-party websites linked from our Site or the Application. Please check the privacy policies on those web sites for more information.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use our Site and the Application. By accessing or using this Site and/or the Application, you agree to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. Your continued use of this Site and the Application after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check this Privacy Policy periodically for updates.

##### GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which became effective on May 25, 2018, creates consistent data protection rules across Europe. It applies to all companies that process data about individuals in the European Union. The GDPR imposes responsibilities on “data controllers” and “data processors.” A company is a “data controller” when it has the responsibility of determining why and how personal data is processed. A company is a “data processor” when it processes personal data on behalf of a data controller. While Cash Raven mostly operates as a data controller, there are some instances in which Cash Raven operates as a data processor, particularly when working with customers and other third parties. To the extent Cash Raven acts as a data processor, Cash Raven is committed to complying with the GDPR’s specific requirements for data processors and we will work with customers and to update any related privacy policies on other websites.

This Policy is designed to address only Cash Raven’s data practices with respect to activities conducted by Cash Raven on its own behalf or through the Site. For those activities, Cash Raven acts as a data controller and may appoint third parties to act as data processor on its behalf, such as Google Analytics, and as further set forth herein. Cash Raven is committed to ensuring that it has appropriate terms in place with such partners so that both Cash Raven and the partners comply with their respective requirements under the GDPR.

Data controllers must have a legal basis to process your personal information. Cash Raven’s legal basis to process your information arises from Cash Raven’s need to use your information to provide you with the services and customer support and to advance Cash Raven’s other legitimate interests (including operating the Site, conducting direct and indirect marketing, etc.), as discussed more fully in this Policy. Cash Raven also relies on your consent in some circumstances as the basis for processing your personal information.

If you are located in the European Union you may have certain rights under the GDPR. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure, (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information, and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. To make such a request, please contact us at support@cashraven.io. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws. If you are a resident of the European Union and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to file a complaint with your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=612080.

##### Age of Users

Our Site and the Application are not intended for children under 13 years of age. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on the Site. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any information on this Site or the Application, make any purchases through the Site or the Application, or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, email address, or any screen name or user name you may use. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have inadvertently and without authorization obtained any information from a child under 13, please contact us.

Individuals who are age 13 or older but under the age of 18 (individually, a “Permitted Minor”, and collectively, “Permitted Minors”) are only allowed to use the Site and the Application with the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a Permitted Minor without the supervision or consent of a parent or legal guardian, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have inadvertently obtained any information from a Permitted Minor without parental consent, please contact us.

California residents under 16 years of age may have additional rights regarding the collection and sale of their personal information. Please see “Your California Privacy Rights” below for more information.

##### Personal Information Collected

We recognize the need for consumers to control the use and management of personal information. By personal information we mean information that can be used to identify or contact an individual. This may include, but is not limited to, a first and last name, a physical address, an email address, a credit card number, a date of birth, or a phone number. We may, from time to time, collect information from parents about a Permitted Minor (for example, we may ask about your child’s date of birth), for purposes of marketing, and providing products and services. If you are a parent providing personal information about a Permitted Minor, your provision of such information constitutes your consent to our collection of such information and your consent to our use of the information for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you are visiting our Site to browse or find information about Cash Raven’s products or services, you do not need to provide any personal information about yourself or about any other person. If you decide to register, however, we may collect this information so that we can provide you with the product or service you requested.

The information we collect on or through our Site and/or Application may include:

- Information that you provide by filling in forms on our Site or the Application. This includes information provided at the time of registering to use our Site and the Application. We may also ask you for information when you report a problem with our Site or the Application.

##### Automatic Information Collected

Like most website operators and social media, we collect certain information automatically, without your input, of the sort that web browsers and servers and social media typically make available, such as your internet connection, operating system, browser type, language preference, referring site or source, location data, and other usage details. Our purpose in collecting this automatic information is to better understand how our visitors use the Site and the Application. This information, and information about internet IP, as well as the date and time web pages are visited, are stored in various security and traffic logs. Our service provider reviews these logs, using statistical analysis, in an effort to track and predict traffic patterns and estimate resource needs. Unless we are tracking down a technical problem or we suspect either fraudulent behavior or illegal conduct, we do not trace specific user sessions. We may also track precise geolocation data, such as location-based information, when you allow our Application to access your location.

##### Supplemental Technologies

Our Site uses browser cookies, session identifiers, JavaScript™, and browser detection technology to provide consumers with a more pleasant, personalized online experience. Many browsers provide consumers with the ability to disable some or all of these technologies. Disabling them, especially in the case of JavaScript™, may prevent you from viewing some webpages. Cookies we use do not place any personally identifiable information on your computer.

##### Information Collected from Other Sources

We may receive personal information about you from companies that help provide our services and the Application. We may also receive personal information from data providers, such as information services and data licensors, and marketing partners, such as companies that have entered into joint marketing relationships or joint ventures with us. We may combine personal information about you that we receive from third parties with information we have already collected about you and use that combined information pursuant to this Privacy Policy.

##### Information Collected from Third Party Platforms

If you communicate with us or mention us via social media (such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, Instagram) or other third party online platforms, we may collect information about your, such as the communications, your name, your user ID and/or username, and any information or content you have permitted the platform to share with us. The platform provider’s privacy policy will apply to your interactions and its collection, use and sharing of your personal information, including when you interact with pages that we maintain on social media platforms. You or the platforms may provide us with information about you, and we will treat such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You should check your privacy settings in your social media accounts to understand and change the information sent to us through the services.
